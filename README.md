# Money-Laundering Prevention

## Problem Statement

The Money-Laundering Prevention project aims to detect potential money laundering activities in financial transactions. The dataset contains information about various financial transactions, including details about the sender, receiver, amounts, currencies, and payment formats.

This is a Binary Classification problem, where the affirmative class indicates suspicious transactions that may be associated with money laundering, while the negative class represents legitimate and non-suspicious transactions.

## Solution Proposed

In this project, the focus is on developing a machine learning model to identify patterns and behaviors that might lead to money laundering. By analyzing historical transaction data, the system aims to flag suspicious activities such as transferring money to foreign banks, large deposits, unusual transaction patterns, and other red flags commonly associated with money laundering.

The objective is to enhance the anti-money laundering efforts and minimize false predictions to reduce the cost and effort related to unnecessary investigations.L
